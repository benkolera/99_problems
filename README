My attempt at creating scala solutions and haskell solutions to the programming
problems listed here: 

http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

Haskell solutions are here, but be careful as the answers are directly on the
page and not hidden. 

http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

If I can keep these in one place, then maybe they may be useful for someone at
some point. 

I'm starting from Scratch with haskell so bear with me while I learn there. I've
done a fair amount of scala, but coming from a Java background I am likely not
to attack these problems in the most Scala orientated way.

If they are here though, I can work on them as my knowledge expands. I hope.
